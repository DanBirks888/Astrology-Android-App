# Astrology DB Android Studio

### The Problem
Love or hate Astrology, the reality is that reading Native charts require a heavy handed amount of Googling <br />
Furthermore, you CANNOT google for example: Moon in Pisces in the 11th House. <br />
Instead you must google: <br>
	- Moon In Pisces <br />
	- Moon In 11th House <br />
	- Pisces in 11th House <br /> <br>
This is not optimal or helpful for the aspiring or curious astrologer
### The Solution
* Get detailed astrological data quick with a maximum of 3 taps on a phone screen.
* Be the first application to combine Planetary, Zodiac and House attributes

### UI Design
* Designed as minimal as possible
* All Native chart signs are the icons on the UI, 
reinforcing beginner knowledge and preparing them to handle Native charts
* All are using TableLayout which can be provide even distribution using 
wrap_content and match_parent android:xml functionality

### Calling the API
AS = Android Studio
* REST functionality is handled by *???* to access the endpoints of my other GitHub project
 backend counterpart Astrology-API.
 * Accessing endpoints via Localhost requires an additional URL query = 10.0.2.2
 * All instance fields which are updated inside the JSONParse method must be inside oncreate();
 as AS cannot instantiate objects before the layout of an activity has been instantiated first.
 * This method will be adapted for use for all planets, signs and houses, 
 but for now, this is the raw functioning method.

 ```java
    private void jsonParse(TextView tv) {
        AndroidNetworking.get("http://10.0.2.2:8080/astrals/planet/Sun")
                .setTag(this)
                .setPriority(Priority.LOW)
                .build()
                .getAsObject(AstralBody.class, new ParsedRequestListener<AstralBody>() {
                    @Override
                    public void onResponse(AstralBody astralBody) {
                        System.out.println("Working!");
                        tv.setText(astralBody.toString());
                    }
                    @Override
                    public void onError(ANError anError) {
                        System.out.println("Error" + anError.getMessage());
                    }
                });
    }
}
 ```
